### My Initial Website Journey

Embarked on my web development journey in February 2022, creating my very first website, originally known as helloevan.dev.<br/>
Despite its HTML/CSS foundation, this project holds a special place as my initial foray into the world of development.<br/>
A real testament to the fact that we all begin somewhere, and my love for the craft continues to grow!
