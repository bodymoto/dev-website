# helloevan.dev | first-time launch
Launched during Feb 2022. My first website and development experience inside an index.html file.<br/>
Written in HTML/CSS with a single JS script sourced by third party, before I learned the JavaScript language.<br/>
Local development supported by VScode Liveserver extension.<br/>
<br/>
### TO PREVIEW
#### Run command:
```python3 -m http.server 8000```<br/>
And visit ```localhost:8000```
